* **Abstract Class:** Can have both implemented methods and abstract methods (no body). Supports constructors and state (fields).
* **Interface:** Only method declarations (prior to Java 8) and can’t have state. Supports multiple inheritance.
* **Key Difference:** Abstract classes define base behavior; interfaces define contracts.
* Java 8+ interfaces can have default methods but still can't hold state.
* You can extend one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.

* **Interface:** Only method declarations (prior to Java 8) and can’t have state. Supports multiple inheritance.
* **Key Difference:** Abstract classes define base behavior; interfaces define contracts.
* Java 8+ interfaces can have default methods but still can't hold state.
* You can extend one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.

2025-06-11 08:05:44,149 [INFO] In normal interview phase. Current topic: java | Last question: That's great!  

Let's start with a basic Java question. Can you tell me the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
 | User input: Sure! Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **Abstract Class:** Can have both implemented methods and abstract methods (no body). Supports constructors and state (fields).
* **Interface:** Only method declarations (prior to Java 8) and can’t have state. Supports multiple inheritance.
* **Key Difference:** Abstract classes define base behavior; interfaces define contracts.
* Java 8+ interfaces can have default methods but still can't hold state.
* You can extend one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.

2025-06-11 08:06:11,877 [INFO] User input received: Sure! I’d use an **abstract class** when multiple classes share common behavior or state, like a `Vehicle` class with shared speed and fuel properties.
I’d choose an **interface** when I want to enforce a contract across unrelated classes, like `Serializable` or `Comparable`.
Abstract classes are great for “is-a” relationships with shared logic.
Interfaces are best for “can-do” capabilities without forcing inheritance.
If I need multiple inheritances of behavior, interfaces are the way to go.

I used **encapsulation** to protect class data with private fields and public getters/setters.

I applied **polymorphism** to write flexible, reusable methods that handled different object types.
These concepts helped me write scalable, maintainable, and modular code throughout my projects.
