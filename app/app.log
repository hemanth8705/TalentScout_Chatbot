* **Abstract Class:** Can have both implemented methods and abstract methods (no body). Supports constructors and state (fields).
* **Interface:** Only method declarations (prior to Java 8) and can’t have state. Supports multiple inheritance.
* **Key Difference:** Abstract classes define base behavior; interfaces define contracts.
* Java 8+ interfaces can have default methods but still can't hold state.
* You can extend one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.

* **Interface:** Only method declarations (prior to Java 8) and can’t have state. Supports multiple inheritance.
* **Key Difference:** Abstract classes define base behavior; interfaces define contracts.
* Java 8+ interfaces can have default methods but still can't hold state.
* You can extend one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.

2025-06-11 08:05:44,149 [INFO] In normal interview phase. Current topic: java | Last question: That's great!  

Let's start with a basic Java question. Can you tell me the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
 | User input: Sure! Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **Abstract Class:** Can have both implemented methods and abstract methods (no body). Supports constructors and state (fields).
* **Interface:** Only method declarations (prior to Java 8) and can’t have state. Supports multiple inheritance.
* **Key Difference:** Abstract classes define base behavior; interfaces define contracts.
* Java 8+ interfaces can have default methods but still can't hold state.
* You can extend one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.

2025-06-11 08:06:11,877 [INFO] User input received: Sure! I’d use an **abstract class** when multiple classes share common behavior or state, like a `Vehicle` class with shared speed and fuel properties.
I’d choose an **interface** when I want to enforce a contract across unrelated classes, like `Serializable` or `Comparable`.
Abstract classes are great for “is-a” relationships with shared logic.
Interfaces are best for “can-do” capabilities without forcing inheritance.
If I need multiple inheritances of behavior, interfaces are the way to go.

I used **encapsulation** to protect class data with private fields and public getters/setters.

I applied **polymorphism** to write flexible, reusable methods that handled different object types.
These concepts helped me write scalable, maintainable, and modular code throughout my projects.

2025-06-11 09:56:51,781 [INFO] User input received: Sure! I built a **RAG-based document assistant** using Python and OpenAI’s LLMs.  
The system retrieved relevant document chunks using FAISS and passed them to the LLM for context-aware answers.  
I used Python for building the Flask API, managing embeddings with `sentence-transformers`, and handling retrieval pipelines.  
A key challenge was optimizing chunking and similarity thresholds to improve accuracy and reduce irrelevant matches.  
This project really deepened my skills in LLM integration, Python API design, and retrieval optimization.

2025-06-11 09:57:15,782 [INFO] User input received: Sure! The key challenge was balancing **chunk size** and **similarity threshold** to ensure relevant, precise retrieval.

I tested different chunking strategies—small chunks improved precision but risked losing context, while larger chunks offered more context but could reduce relevance.
I settled on **adaptive chunking**, splitting based on semantic units like headings and paragraphs.

For similarity thresholds, I fine-tuned cosine similarity cutoffs through iterative testing and user feedback to minimize irrelevant matches.

Result: Retrieval precision improved significantly, and users consistently received contextually accurate responses.

2025-06-11 09:57:15,782 [INFO] User input received: Sure! The key challenge was balancing **chunk size** and **similarity threshold** to ensure relevant, precise retrieval.

I tested different chunking strategies—small chunks improved precision but risked losing context, while larger chunks offered more context but could reduce relevance.
I settled on **adaptive chunking**, splitting based on semantic units like headings and paragraphs.

Our conversation started with you providing some basic information about yourself: your name, email, phone number, years of experience, desired position, current location, and tech stack.

Then, we dove into your experience with a project you built using Python, LLMs, and RAG. You described a document assistant that retrieved relevant chunks from documents using FAISS and an LLM for context-aware answers.

You highlighted the challenge you faced in optimizing chunking and similarity thresholds for accurate retrieval. You talked about your solution, which involved adaptive chunking based on semantic units and iteratively fine-tuning the similarity threshold through testing and user feedback.

This led to a significant improvement in retrieval precision and contextually accurate responses. 

Would you like to expand on any of these points or talk about something else?

2025-06-11 09:58:15,934 [INFO] In normal interview phase. Current topic: RAG applications | Last question: Sounds good!

Let's talk about your understanding of how LLMs are different from traditional search engines. Can you explain some key distinctions?  




 | User input: Sure! Here are the key differences:

* **Traditional Search Engines** retrieve documents based on keyword matching and ranking algorithms.
* **LLMs** generate human-like responses by understanding context and patterns from vast training data.
* Search engines return links or document excerpts; LLMs can synthesize answers directly.
* LLMs can handle ambiguous or conversational queries more naturally.
* Search engines are great for broad retrieval; LLMs excel at nuanced, context-rich responses.

Using LLMs with RAG, we can build systems that provide **patient-specific answers** by retrieving relevant medical records and trusted clinical guidelines.

It can assist doctors with **quick, accurate insights** while ensuring the context is always up-to-date and grounded in reliable sources.

This could significantly improve decision-making and patient outcomes.
