      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You: A **lambda function** is an anonymous, one-line function in Python using the `lambda` keyword. It‚Äôs used for short, simple operations without formally defining a function. **Syntax:** `lambda x: x * 2` vs. regular function `def double(x): return x * 2`. Lambdas are common in `map()`, `filter()`, and sorting. Regular functions are better for complex, multi-line logic.\n",

      "* **\"Anonymous\"**: Emphasize that lambda functions don't have a name like regular functions. \n",

      "* **Use Cases**:\n",
      "    *  Give more specific examples of how lambdas are used with `map()`, `filter()`, and sorting. For example, you could say:\n",
      "        *  `map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3])` would square each number in the list.\n",
      "        *  `filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4])` would return only the even numbers.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Emphasize Anonymity:**  Reiterate that lambda functions are *anonymous*, meaning they don't have a name like regular functions defined with `def`. This distinguishes them from named functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Single Expression Rule:**  Be very clear that lambdas can *only* contain a single expression. They cannot have multiple statements or blocks of code like regular functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Use Cases:** Provide more specific examples of how lambdas shine in practical applications:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *  **`map()`:**  Imagine you want to square each number in a list: `map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3, 4])` \n",
      "    *  **`filter()`:** You want to select only even numbers from a list: `filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4])`\n",
      "    *  **Sorting:**  You could use lambdas as keys for sorting lists based on specific criteria: `sorted(names, key=lambda name: name[0])` (sorts names alphabetically by the first letter)\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Readability for Complexity:**  While lambdas are great for brevity, acknowledge that for more complex logic, regular functions are often more readable and maintainable.\n",

      "    *  **`filter()`:** You want to select only even numbers from a list: `filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4])`\n",
      "    *  **Sorting:**  You could use lambdas as keys for sorting lists based on specific criteria: `sorted(names, key=lambda name: name[0])` (sorts names alphabetically by the first letter)\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Readability for Complexity:**  While lambdas are great for brevity, acknowledge that for more complex logic, regular functions are often more readable and maintainable.\n",
